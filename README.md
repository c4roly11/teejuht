# Teejuht – Anonymous Advice Platform (Frontend Project)

**Teejuht** is an Estonian-language **frontend** project designed to provide a safe and anonymous space where people can seek advice and share personal experiences with others who’ve gone through similar life challenges. The platform is aimed at fostering a sense of community and support—especially in areas like mental health, financial difficulties, or other personal issues.

This is a **school project** developed by **me and my classmate**. The website is currently hosted and accessible via the **Turing server**. While the app includes a working interface, it **does not have backend functionality** (e.g., real data storage, authentication, etc.).

The project is hosted on the **Turing server** and can be accessed here:  [http://turing.cs.ttu.ee/~arajas/iti0209/](http://turing.cs.ttu.ee/~arajas/iti0209/)

Note: The original repository and collaboration took place in a private GitLab project due to course requirements.
